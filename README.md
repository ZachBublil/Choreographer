# Download
Download the latest AAR via Gradle:
```
implementation 'zachinio.choreographer:choreographer:1.0.8'
```

# How to use
To run animation serially
```
 Choreographer()
            .addAnimation(EnterAnimation(view, EnterAnimation.Direction.TOP, 560))
            .addAnimation(FadeAnimation(view,0.2f,560))
            .animate()
```
Use "addAnimationAsync" method to add animations asynchronously
```
  Choreographer()
            .addAnimation(EnterAnimation(view, EnterAnimation.Direction.TOP, 560))
            .addAnimation(FadeAnimation(otherView,0.2f,560))
            .addAnimationAsync(ScaleAnimation(otherView, 0.5f, 0.5f, 560))
            .animate()
```

To add delay between animations
```
   Choreographer()
            .addAnimation(EnterAnimation(view, EnterAnimation.Direction.TOP, 560))
            .wait(1900) // mills
            .addAnimation(FadeAnimation(otherView,0.2f,560))
            .addAnimationAsync(ScaleAnimation(otherView, 0.5f, 0.5f, 560))
            .animate()
```

To add a side effect between animations
```
   Choreographer()
            .addAnimation(EnterAnimation(view, EnterAnimation.Direction.TOP, 560))
            .runSideEffect(runnable) 
            .addAnimation(FadeAnimation(otherView,0.2f,560))
            .addAnimationAsync(ScaleAnimation(otherView, 0.5f, 0.5f, 560))
            .animate()
```

# Customize animations
The library contains some basic animations, if you want to chain a custom animation you can do it by extending from Animation class of the library and perform the animation inside the "animate" method.
